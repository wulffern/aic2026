<!--pan_title: The Story of Jayn-->

I want to tell you a story about Jayn. Jayn is an electron. Just one among
countless others. There's nothing particularly special about Jayn, but Jayn plays
an important role in our story.


At one point in Jayn's long life, without knowing it, Jayn would cause problems for
me -- but that's not where his story begins.


Jayn's story begins 13.8 billion years ago. Jayn popped into existence out of the
vacuum, seemingly alone in the world. Well, not entirely alone. Jayn was
surrounded by cousins and siblings, an ocean of elementary particles. There were
quarks, there were electrons, and they all swam together in a sea of raw energy
and matter.


Before long, the quarks got tired of floating around on their own. They clumped
together, forming protons and nutrons -- massive beasts compared to little Jayn. Jayn didn't
like this new, crowded world. Jayn loved the freedom of zipping around the
universe unbound. But eventually, Jayn felt a tug -- a deep, irresistible attraction
to one of those giant protons. And with that, Jayn became part of something new:
a hydrogen atom.

Jayn lived in that hydrogen atom for billions of years. Over time, Jayn joined
with other hydrogen atoms, coalescing into a star. Jayn basked in the warmth of
the stars outer layers, content as the star burned brightly in the universe.

Eventually, though, Jayn's hydrogen atom drifted toward the star's core. There,
something new happened. Instead of circling just one proton, Jayn now orbited
two. A new proton had joined, forming helium. This meant there was space for
another electron too -- Jayn's first real companion.

They shared the same orbital space, something Jayn had never experienced before.
Usually, if another electron came too close, one of them would be pushed away.
But not this time. This was different. They could exist in the same place, with
the same energy. How? Physicists would later call it "spin". Jayn didn't know
what "spin" meant, it was weird, but Jayn liked it. It meant Jayn wasn't alone.

Jayn was happy in the helium atom, but the universe never stands still. Another
proton came, then another, and eventually Jayn was part of a silicon
atom, orbiting a nucleus with 14 protons and -- of course -- 14 electrons.

Jayn was no longer close to the nucleus. Now, Jayn was far out on the edge of the atom, in the
outermost orbital shell. From there, Jayn could feel the presence of everything around
-- not just the self atom, but all the neighboring atoms as well.

One day, everything
changed. The star exploded -- a supernova -- and Jayn was flung
across the universe.

For a time, Jayn was adrift. Not alone, but not close to anything
familiar. Eventually, Jayn was caught in the gravity of a forming planet -- the one
we now call Earth. The silicon atom joined with other atoms, mostly oxygen, bound together by Jayn's shared orbital shell between the atoms. 
It was easier to share the electrons than to be apart. The
allure of the other atoms wasn't strong, but it was always there.

Jayn spent billions of years as part of the silicon atom, tumbling through Earth's oceans,
sometimes bonding with other atoms, sometimes drifting free. One day, Jayn washed
up on a beach, part of a grain of sand. And there Jayn stayed for a long, long
time.

Now and then, Jayn was swept out to sea, then returned, living a simple,
chaotic, quiet life.

But even quiet lives face change. One day, Jayn was picked up -- scooped up in a
bucket of sand, melted down, and turned into something new. Melted just meant more energy, more vibration. 
Sometimes, because of the vibrations, Jayn even had enough energy to escape the atom 
briefly before settling back down. But this
time was different.

This time, Jayn became part of something incredibly uniform: a crystal lattice
where every atom was another silicon atom, each in perfect order, with each atom sharing it's
 four outermost electrons in orbital shells with the neighbours. For
the first time, Jayn could feel the full, equal pull of the electrons and nuclei
around -- like a vast, invisible ocean of charges. It was electrifying.


<!--Time usually passed slowly for Jayn. Electrons moved so fast that the rest of
the universe seemed to crawl. But now, she could feel something speeding up. -->


<!-- Electrons were whizzing by—sometimes so fast that they couldn't physically move
any faster, bumping into other atoms in their haste. A disturbance. She couldn't
tell what it was, only that it was coming. -->

Then one day, it happened. Another electron struck. It hit hard -- so hard that Jayn was knocked from the 
orbital shell. For a brief moment, Jayn was free. Jayn flew through the crystal lattice,
disoriented,then through something that was not a crystal
lattice, but rather a jumbled mess of crystal
pieces, until Jayn found another open spot -- an empty energy state -- where Jayn
could settle again. It was strange but exhilarating.

And did you know? The presence of just that one electron -- Jayn -- in the gate oxide of a transistpr 
was enough to
shift the threshold voltage, change the flow of bias current, alter the
frequency of an oscillator, cause my phone
to loose the Bluetooth link to my door look, and made me swear a number of
times until the Bluetooth link finally reconnected, many, many, many seconds later.

And yet, Jayn's story doesn't end. Because Jayn, like all electrons, never really
ends. Jayn may pop in and out of existence, but is always there -- unchanged,
identical to all cousins and siblings.

The only differences between the electrons are where they are, their momentum and yes, their "spin". 
They are responsible for all chemical reactions in the universe. And their
path through space-time is described by the complex mathematics of the Schrodinger equation.

So ends the story of Jayn -- our 13.8 billion-year-old troublemaker.
